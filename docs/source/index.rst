Welcome to Tin
==============

Welcome to Tin!

Tin is a code autograder written for Computer Science classes at Thomas
Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

Previously, teachers in TJHSST CS classes had to manually run student code.
As you can imagine, this was both time consuming, and dangerous.
In order to solve this problem, Tin was invented to safely run student code submissions.
