  <p>Every assignment has a grader script that is run to grade each submission. This page details how to write graders
    for <code>tin</code>.</p>
  <p class="bold">Warning: It isn't as simple as it sounds. Certain restrictions put in place by the system create traps
    that are very easy to fall into, and you should read this entire page before writing a grader script.</p>

  <p>When a submission is uploaded, the grader script is passed the following arguments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The full path to a Python program that, when run, will run the student's submission. This separate script is
      required for reasons that will be explained later.
    </li>
    <li>The full path to the student's actual submission file, in case parsing of it is required for some purpose. Do
      not run this directly.
    </li>
    <li>
      The submitting student's username.
      <ul>
        <li>Do not parse the submission filename to extract this information (or any other information) as the format
          for submission filenames may change without warning.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The full path to a log file that the grader can write logs to. The log file is not created automatically, but its
      path is always passed to the grader file, so the grader script can easily create it if it doesn't exist and then
      append new output to it. Once the file has been created, the assignment information page will show a button with a
      link to download the log.<br>
      <span class="bold">Note: Since multiple submissions for the same lab may be run at the same time, it is recommended that the grader not open or write to the logfile until immediately before it exits. This will minimize any issues caused by multiple instances of the grader writing to the same file.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Why is it not recommended to run the student's submission directly? Well, running student-uploaded scripts without
    any kind of restrictions in place is always a bad idea, as it allows students to upload malicious scripts that, for
    example, read other students' submissions and copy them to a location the student can later access. As such, a
    system was put in place that limits the access that student submissions have by default. The implementation of this
    system necessitated the creation of a "wrapper script" for each submission that runs the submission in an
    appropriately restricted environment.</p>
  <p>Summary: The first argument that is passed is a "wrapper script" that runs the student's submission while limiting
    the access the submission has in order to prevent cheating.</p>

  <h2>Directory structure</h2>
  <p>Currently, <code>tin</code> follows the following directory structure for assignments and submission.</p>
  <p>This structure assumes a single submission from <code>2020awilliam</code> on 01/01/2019 at 12:34 AM.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>grader.py</code> &ndash; The grader script</li>
    <li><code>grader.log</code> &ndash; The grader's logfile (not automatically created, but recognized specially by
      <code>tin</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>2020awilliam/</code> &ndash; A directory containing everything related to a particular student's submissions
      <ul>
        <li><code>submission_20190101_001234.py</code> &ndash; The actual submission (do not run directly)</li>
        <li>
          <code>wrappers/</code> &ndash; The directory containing the submission wrappers
          <ul>
            <li><code>submission_20190101_001234.py</code> &ndash; The submission wrapper</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="bold">Note: This is subject to change at any time, and the only lasting guarantee made about this structure
    is that all of a particular student's submissions will be in the same directory. This structure is solely provided
    as a visual aid.</p>

  <h2>Restrictions placed on student submissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1GB memory limit, and restrictions on the number of external programs that can be launched</li>
    <li>By default, not able to access the Internet</li>
    <li>Only able to access the submission itself, not any other files</li>
    <li>Not able to change the submission file</li>
    <li>Very restricted access to the rest of the filesystem</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="bold">Warning: Many of these restrictions can be bypassed if the grader script uses output from a student's
    submission in an unsafe way (such as <code>eval()</code>ing or <code>pickle.load()</code>ing it). <code>tin</code>
    runs the grader script in its own restricted environment, but all this can really do is prevent the submission from
    affecting code for other assignments. Please be careful.</p>
  <p>The Internet access restriction can be lifted on a per-assignment basis by going to the assignment's "Edit" page
    and checking the box labeled "Give submissions internet access." However, this should be done with caution, as
    giving scripts Internet access makes it much easier for students to cheat.</p>
  <p>The memory restriction is currently hardcoded in and cannot be changed. 1GB should be enough for many cases, but if
    it becomes an issue, please contact <a href="mailto:{{ DEVELOPER_EMAIL }}"><code>tin</code>'s developers</a> to
    increase the limit.</p>
  <p>Submissions can be given access to specific files by passing additional arguments to the wrapper script as follows
    (these must precede any other arguments to be passed to the submission):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>--write &lt;filename&gt;</code>: Give the submission read/write access to the specified file. The filename
      should be given as an absolute path.
    </li>
    <li><code>--read &lt;filename&gt;</code>: Give the submission read-only access to the specified file. The filename
      should be given as an absolute path.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you need to upload specific read-only files for student code to use, please contact the Tin team at <a
    href="mailto:tin@tjhsst.edu">tin@tjhsst.edu</a>.</p>
  <p>The special argument <code>--</code> may be passed to the wrapper script after all of the file restrictions have
    been passed to denote that the wrapper should stop parsing arguments and pass the rest of the arguments directly to
    the student's submission.<p>

  <h2>Grader scripts and files</h2>
  <p>Grader scripts should only write to files in the directory containing the grader script itself (i.e. <code>os.path.dirname(__file__)</code>)
    and the directory containing the student submission (i.e. <code>os.path.dirname(sys.argv[2])</code>). Files placed
    in other locations may cause conflict with other graders, but these directories are guaranteed to be specific to
    each grader.</p>
  <p>The submission directories are actually created in the grader script directory. Each submission directory's name is
    the username of the student, so attempting to create a file in the grader script directory with the same name as a
    student's username will lead to errors.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, files with the text "grader" in their name may be created by the server, so please avoid using these
    names. For example, at the time of this writing the grader script is saved as <code>grader.py</code> and its log
    file is saved as <code>grader.log</code>.</p>
  <p>Additionally, since all of a student's submissions are placed in the same directory, files created in the
    submission directory (for example, filenames passed to the submission as output files) should be given random names
    to avoid conflicts in case the student uploads a second submission while their last submission has not yet been
    graded.</p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>All of these run the submission with read-only access to <code>input.txt</code> in the grader script directory,
    read-write access to <code>output.txt</code> (in practice, the names should be randomized and/or dependent on the
    student's username) in the submission directory, and the command-line arguments <code>abc</code> and
    <code>123</code>.</p>
  <pre><code class="nohljsln">subprocess.run([sys.argv[1], "--read", os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "input.txt"), "--write", os.path.join(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[2]), "output.txt"), "abc", "123"])</code></pre>
  (avoid this style; always pass <code>--</code> so it is clear where the wrapper script arguments end)
  <pre><code class="nohljsln">subprocess.run([sys.argv[1], "--read", os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "input.txt"), "--write", os.path.join(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[2]), "output.txt"), "--", "abc", "123"])</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="nohljsln">subprocess.run([sys.argv[1], "--write", os.path.join(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[2]), "output.txt"), "--read", os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "input.txt"), "--", "abc", "123"])</code></pre>
  <p>The following code does not do what the author intended. It runs the submission with two arguments: the string
    <code>"--read"</code> and the path to a file named <code>input.txt</code> in the grader script directory. It does
    NOT give the script read access to <code>input.txt</code>.</p>
  <p>
  <pre><code class="nohljsln">subprocess.run([sys.argv[1], "--", "--read", os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "input.txt")])</code></pre>

  <h2>Grader script output</h2>
  <p>Students can only see output from the grader that has been printed on the standard output (<code>sys.stdout</code>).
    Output on the standard error (<code>sys.stderr</code>) can only be viewed by teachers. This is to prevent students
    from accidentally seeing a solution in the output if the grader throws an exception.</p>
  <p>However, if the grader script exits with a non-zero status code (which Python does by default when an exception is
    raised) the student will see the text <code>[Grader error]</code> at the end of the output. If the grader exceeds
    its timeout (as set in the assignment "Edit" page), the student will see the text <code>[Grader timed out]</code>.
    Similar text will also be added to the error output.</p>
  <h2>Automatic scoring</h2>
  <p>Each submission has a "Score" field that can be set by the grader. If this field is set, you will be able to see a
    list of each student's scores on the assignment's page, which is designed to make entering grades into the gradebook
    easier.</p>
  <p>To set this field, the grader simply needs to output <code>Score: &lt;score&gt;</code> as the last line of its
    output. This line is case-sensitive and the spacing must be exactly right (no trailing spaces!). Scores can be
    percentages (such as <code>90%</code>) or they can simply be a number of points. In either case, they are
    interpreted as being out of the "Points possible" value set on the assignment "Edit" page.</p>
  <p>Note: If the grader times out or exits with a non-zero status code, this auto-scoring will not take place. This is
    to prevent inaccurate scores in the event of a grader error.</p>
